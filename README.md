## Abstract

This repository contributes to explore policy-gradient RL agents in the MuJoCo Gym **Hopper** environment. These include REINFORCE, Advantage Actor–Critic (A2C), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). This research also contributes to the comparison of Uniform Domain Randomization (UDR) with Domain Randomization Optimization IDentification (DROID) to improve robustness and sim-to-real transfer. Results characterize algorithmic trade-offs and inform domain-randomization refinement to reduce the reality gap.
